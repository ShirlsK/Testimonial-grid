## 🌐 Live Site

- Live URL: *[Add your live site URL here, e.g. GitHub Pages or Netlify]*

## 🛠️ Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Custom CSS styling based on provided style guide

## 🎨 The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size (responsive)
- See a well-structured testimonials grid as per the design

## ✏️ My Process

### How I built the project:

- Started by setting up the HTML structure and grid system.
- Styled the layout using CSS Grid for desktop and used media queries for mobile responsiveness.
- Used the provided style guide for consistent colors, typography, and spacing.
- Added personal touches and adjusted the layout to ensure it looks good on different screen sizes.

### What I learned:

- Practiced using **CSS Grid** to build complex grid layouts.
- Improved understanding of **responsive design** with media queries.
- Learned to work with provided design files and style guides.

## 🚧 Future Improvements

- Improve accessibility (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)
- Add smooth animations or transitions for testimonials
- Optimize for even better responsiveness across all screen sizes
